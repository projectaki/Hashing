# PBKDF2 Password hasher
This project is a Java implementation of PBKDF2 algorithm using SHA-512 hashing to hash passwords.
## Use
It uses an iteration size which can be changed, this increases the amount of time the hash function is computed in,
which slows down attacks made to crack hashes with a brute-force approach, without affecting the user XP.
